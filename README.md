# Array-Question

1. Find the maximum element in an array
* Logic: Traverse and compare each element to find the largest one.
2. Find the second largest element in an array
* Logic: Maintain two variables max and secondMax while iterating.
3. Reverse an array
* Logic: Use two pointers (start and end) and swap elements.
4. Remove duplicates from an array
* Logic: Check if the element already exists before adding to a result array.
5. Check if an array is sorted (ascending or descending)
* Logic: Compare each element with the next.
6. Find the sum of all elements
* Logic: Loop through and keep a running total.
7. Find the frequency of each element
* Logic: Use a dictionary or nested loops.
8. Count even and odd numbers in an array
* Logic: Use number % 2 to classify each.
9. Find all pairs in the array whose sum is equal to a given number
* Logic: Use nested loops or a set to track complements.
10. Merge two sorted arrays
* Logic: Use two pointers to merge into a new sorted array.
11. Left rotate the array by 1 position
* Logic: Remove the first element and push it at the end.
12. Move all zeros to the end
* Logic: Shift non-zero elements and fill remaining with zero.
13. Find the common elements in two arrays
* Logic: Use nested loops or sets for intersection.
14. Find the element that appears only once (others appear twice)
* Logic: Use XOR logic or a frequency map.
15. Find the missing number in a consecutive array
* Logic: Use sum formula or XOR approach.
